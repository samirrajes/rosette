# Rosette

"Rosette" is a Processing project inspired by the Rosette Nebula, using generative art techniques to dynamically simulate nebula-like structures. The core of the simulation leverages Perlin noise to generate a smooth, natural-looking randomness, influencing the nebula's circular shape and intensity fading towards the center and edges, which creates a sense of depth. Stars are randomly placed with varying brightness to enhance the scene's realism, and Perlin noise also simulates fluctuating energy at the center of the nebula, adding to the dynamic nature of the simulation. Interactive controls allow users to pause the animation, resume, and save frames.
